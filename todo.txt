Goal: enable KOS to fully automate a career KSP game

Since KOS cannot run without a vessel, I imagine that most of this will be done 
using a "controller vessel," perhaps sitting on the runway and setting up rocket launches.

Necessary functionality:
* assign crew to launches
* crew transfers (not strictly necessary because of kos-eva cheats)

-------------------- completed
* enumerate contracts
* accept contracts
* purchase tech tree nodes
* recover non-current vessel (might have bugs...)
* building upgrades
* might need some UI controls to close science window, etc

-------------------- polish
* purchasing parts in tech tree nodes (hard mode)
* enumerate links in tech tree (probably new RDNode type)
* enumerate available kerbals
* hire kerbals
* activate strategies

-------------------- no work necessary
* eva support (use kos-eva for this, but it probably needs improvements e.g. boot script for kerbals)
* eva activate nearby parts
